# Food-Ordering-System-Otlob
Object oriented programming course's project.

OOP Final Project using C++ with GUI-Database-Files ( Food ordering Portal Management system)

The Customer Visits the Online Ordering Portal to purchase meals from the internet. The Customer Can select a Governorate(Cairo-Alexandria-beni suif,Asuit..etc) ,the an address/area(Abbasiya, 6th of october..etc) ,to get a list of over all Restaurants available in the address chosen. Then the customer can search through this list with a food category(Grills, Sea food,Lebanese Sandwiches,Pizza ,Oriental,Fast Foods,Japanese food,Shawermas..etc) . To get the different Restaurants in the desired Category. Such that a restaurant can be included in different categories. Once the customer chooses a certain Restaurant , he can add items with specified quantity to his Order from the menu of available food items that contains all the items and the prices partitioned into segments of (Main Meals ( which can be individual or family)-Side Plates(fries, soups,rice..etc)-Appetizers(optional)-desserts(optional)- Salads(optionals)-Drinks). the items that are viewed can be added to the Order with any quantity specified. As the Customer finishes selecting the items the order can be viewed and edited. Also allow him to pay for his order online using his credit card or just pay for it hand by hand when he receives the order. The Order contains the delivery fee. If the customer is visiting the portal for the first time he has to register else, he can Login to the portal in order to make payments. The customer can use vouchers to get special offers when ordering. A voucher can be a discount with a certain percentage of the total order price , or a certain amount of money discount from the order price. Write a C++ program that manages customers and their orders.

Customer must register first to be able to make order.
Each Customer can make multiple orders and each order can contain multiple items from the restaurant Menu.
The Order is associated with an estimated delivery time.
A Customer can view a list of Restaurants whom have special offers today which is updated every day.
Any Customer can rate a restaurant from 1 to 5 stars and write a comment on the restaurant.
You Must
keep track on the quantity of each item or a specific segment type in the menu you have in restaurants; and if you run out of an item or a segment is not available then you should not allow any customer to buy it.

The Customer Gets A voucher with" 30% discount from the total order Price" when he first creates an account. Also he can get a voucher with a certain money amount (ex: 50 L.E off) on his birthday.
The system also should manage the employees who deliver the orders to the customers and assign orders to them. Each delivery boy cannot deliver more than 2 orders at a time. At the end of each order you must show a bill that contains. 1- The customer data. 2- The delivery boy data. 3- The list of requested items with the total price plus the delivery charges. 4- The delivery date. A Customer can cancel an order within 10 minutes after it has been issued . A Customer can give feed - back about the delivered food and the delivery process and add suggestions to the restaurant . A Customer can return the order after receiving it and send a complain to the restaurant about the state/quality of the returned food (not fresh-not warm..etc).
